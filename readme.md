This assignment to create a leaderboard for our project example (/assets/Daily View.jpg), which needs to be completed within three days from now. Your task is to design and implement a leaderboard that displays the top 10 scores of players.

# Key Requirements:

1. Responsive Design: The leaderboard should adjust seamlessly across different display sizes, ensuring that only top 10 scores should be shown.

2. Auto-Scrolling Footer: The bottom image footer should auto-scroll to enhance the user experience and aesthetic appeal of the page.

3. Color Scheme: You have the creative freedom to choose a color scheme that not only meets the functional requirements but also looks visually appealing.

4. Implement an "Add Score" popup feature with specific fields:

    ## Add Score Popup Details:
    * Username: Input field for the player's username (string).
    * Score: Input field formatted as MM:SS::MSS
    (minutes:seconds:milliseconds) for the player's score.
    
    ## Enhancements:
    * Smooth Animation: When a new score is added, implement a smooth animation effect to visually display the new entry.
    
    * Dynamic Entry: If the new score does not initially rank in the top 10, the leaderboard should automatically scroll to the correct position for the new score and smoothly insert it into the list.


# Additional Details:

- Data Generation: Dummy data for scores and usernames can be used for development and testing purposes.

**Upon completion of the project, please provide the following:**

1. GitHub Repository Link: Share the link to the repository where the project code is hosted.
2. Hosted Link: Host the project on a free platform such as Firebase, Heroku, etc., and provide the URL for access.


All the required assets are stored in the assets folder (/assets)
Feel free to ask any questions or seek clarification on the requirements. I look forward to seeing your implementation.
